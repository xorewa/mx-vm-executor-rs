// SAFETY: this unsafe assertion is **structurally unsound** on the
// type level: `std::rc::Weak<T>` is `!Send + !Sync` regardless of T
// (it uses non-atomic refcount manipulation). Asserting Send + Sync
// here is a contract the *compiler cannot validate* — it would never
// have compiled with the type-derived auto-traits alone.
//
// The experimental executor is single-threaded in practice and the
// wasmer engine is configured to dispatch host calls on the same
// thread that constructed the wrapper. As long as that invariant
// holds, the assertion below is not observably unsound — but the
// audit finding is correct that the assertion is not type-safe.
//
// The proper fix is to swap `Rc / Rc::Weak` for `Arc / Arc::Weak`
// throughout the experimental executor (ExperimentalInstanceInner
// and ExperimentalInstanceState's wasmer_inner field both need the
// same change). That is a real refactor with performance / semantic
// implications and is tracked as a separate scope from the
// production wasmer path's fix.
//
// The production `vm-executor-wasmer` crate follows the upstream
// MultiversX model: VM hooks are stored behind `Rc<dyn VMHooksLegacy>`
// and the Wasmer environment wrapper carries the required unsafe
// Send/Sync assertion. This experimental crate has the same WasmerEnv
// requirement, but its broader Rc graph still needs a dedicated audit
// before changing the ownership model.
